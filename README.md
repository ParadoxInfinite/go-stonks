# Stonks App

A small emulation of a Stock exchange written in [Go](https://golang.org/) for the backend and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for the app.

### Why?

Inspiration from @sasidakh made me want to learn Go and @yashwp put this idea across as a learning assignment. Learning a new language/technology while designing a very small system obviously is better than writing 'Hello World!' and quitting.

### Getting Started

1. [Go Server](https://github.com/ParadoxInfinite/go-stonks/tree/master/go-server/README.md)
2. [Stonks App (Flutter)](https://github.com/ParadoxInfinite/go-stonks/tree/master/stonks/README.md)

### Tech Stack

- Server - Golang
    - [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/) - Go package for websocket implementation
- Database - [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Client App - Flutter

### Additional Tools Used
1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - For testing the WS server
